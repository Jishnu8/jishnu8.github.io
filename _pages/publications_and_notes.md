Below you can find a brief selection of my expository write-ups and project reports on topics I have been studying.

### Selected Write-Ups

1. An Exposition of the Area Formula [\[*PDF*\]](/files/area_formula.pdf)   
    *Master’s project in Geometric Measure Theory — Semester 3 Mid-Sem Report*        
    *Brief Abstract*: 
    The aim of this report is to present an exposition of the area formula and the generalized
    change of variables formula, fundamental results in geometric measure theory, first proved
    by Herbert Federer. The guiding question is the following: given a set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, can we
    relate the “n-dimensional volume” of its image under a Lipschitz map $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$
    (where $n \le m$) to something simpler, namely the “first-order approximation” of $f$ at
    each point? This question should not feel unfamiliar as it extends a result already known for a narrower class of maps, namely $C^1$ functions by the classical change of variables. As we shall see, the area formula provides an affirmative answer in this more general setting, leading to a generalized change of variables formula for Lipschitz maps.

2. The Generalized Divergence Theorem for Sobolov Functions and the Co-Area Formula for BV Functions [\[*PDF*\]](/files/coarea_formula_for_BV_functions.pdf)    
    *Master’s project in Geometric Measure Theory — Semester 3 End-Sem Report*   
    *Brief Abstract*: This report provides an exposition of two central results in geometric measure theory: the
    generalized divergence theorem for Sobolev functions and the co-area formula for functions of bounded variation. The former generalizes the familiar divergence theorem in smooth calculus, while the latter expresses the total variation of a function as an integral of the perimeters of its superlevel sets, generalizing both Fubini’s theorem and the classical co-area formula for Lipschitz functions.  These results are useful and arise naturally in the study of PDEs, variational problems, and the theory of minimal surfaces. 

3. Allard’s Regularity Theorem *[Expected: Feb 2026 and May 2026]*    
    *Master’s project in Geometric Measure Theory — Topic planned for semester 4; mid-sem and final reports will be posted when available*

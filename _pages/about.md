I am a second-year Master’s student in Mathematics at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. My current  Master’s thesis is in Geometric Measure Theory, supervised under Prof. Partha Sarathi Chakraborty. During May–July 2025, I participated in a research program at the Australian National University, Canberra, supervised by Prof. Ben Andrews, focusing on topics in Geometric Analysis. Previously, I completed my Bachelor’s in Mathematics (Dec 2020 – Oct 2023) at the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education.

Broadly speaking, my interests lie in problems at the interface of analysis and geometry. This includes topics in areas such as geometric analysis, geometric measure theory, and harmonic analysis. Some of the many topics I am currently exploring, along with others I hope to investigate in the future, include:

- Minimal Surfaces 
- Problems related to the Kakeya Conjecture
- Questions on the Existence of Closed Geodesics

Although no longer my focus, I also had a strong interest in machine learning during my Bachelor's, completing an industrial role at a fintech company and two remote research internships, one of which led to a publication in ML.

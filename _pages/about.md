I am a second-year Master’s student in Mathematics at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. My current  Master’s thesis is in Geometric Measure Theory, supervised under Prof. Partha Sarathi Chakraborty. During May–July 2025, I participated in a research program at the Australian National University, Canberra, supervised by Prof. Ben Andrews, focusing on topics in Geometric Analysis. Previously, I completed my Bachelor’s in Mathematics (Dec 2020 – Oct 2023) at the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education.

Broadly speaking, my interests lie in problems at the interface of analysis and geometry. This includes topics in areas such as geometric analysis, geometric measure theory, and harmonic analysis. Some of the many topics I am interested in include:

- Plateau’s problem, which asks for the existence of an area-minimizing surface spanning a given boundary.
- Problems in Euclidean harmonic analysis, including the Kakeya conjecture and related questions.
- Other questions in Geometric Analysis, such as existence of closed geodesics

Although no longer my focus, I also had a strong interest in machine learning during my Bachelor's, completing an industrial role at a fintech company and two remote research internships.
